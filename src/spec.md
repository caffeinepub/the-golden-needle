# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the displayed business email ID in the Contact section.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the Contact Information email text in `frontend/src/components/sections/ContactSection.tsx` from `info@goldenneedle.com` to `thegoldenneedle07`.
- Preserve the existing muted styling (`text-muted-foreground`) and leave all other contact details unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** The Contact section shows the email exactly as “thegoldenneedle07” with the same styling as before.
