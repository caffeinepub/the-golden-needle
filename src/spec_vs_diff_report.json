  "summary": "REQ-16 (update Contact section email text to exactly \"thegoldenneedle07\") appears to be implemented per the repository summary, but the provided ContactSection.tsx diff is truncated before the contact info rendering, so the exact email string and whether `text-muted-foreground` styling is preserved cannot be fully verified from the snippet. Additionally, ContactSection.tsx includes unrequested form-behavior changes (validation, success state), and non-requested metadata/state files were modified.",
